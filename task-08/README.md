### TailwindCSS

Both projects use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

To support Tailwind with React Native, the Expo app uses [twnrc](https://github.com/jaredh159/tailwind-react-native-classnames).

To use Tailwind Intellisense in VSCode:

- Install [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- Add `style` attribute to the _Class Attributes_ setting in the extension's configuration
