# Letterboxd Requirements Specification (SRS) Explained

## What is an SRS?  
A **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document provides a detailed and structured description of the project goals, key features, and design principles. It serves as a blueprint for developers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure alignment and clarity throughout the

SRS is a kind of agreement between the customer and the company, which contains complete information about the requirement desired by the customer and the product made by the company.

SRS is a document that describes what the features of the software will be and what its behaviour will be, i.e. how it will perform.

## Purpose of the SRS  
The SRS document for the Letterboxd-like project aims to:  
- Define the **scope** of the project.  
- Describe the **functional and technical requirements** in detail.  
- Establish a **common understanding** for the users.
- Serve as a reference during development phases.

## Key Sections of the SRS  

### 1. **Functional Requirements**  
This section outlines the core features of the platform:  
- **User Registration and Login:** Secure account creation and authentication.  
- **Movie Database:** Comprehensive movie details (titles, genres, release dates, posters, etc.), with search and filtering capabilities.  
- **Watchlists and Reviews:** Tools for users to create/manage watchlists, write reviews, and rate movies.  
- **Social Features:** Following other users, liking, and commenting on reviews.  
- **Recommendations:** Personalized suggestions using machine learning.

### 2. **UX Design Requirements**  
Defines how the platform should appear and function for users:  
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and user-friendly interface optimized for desktop, mobile, and tablet.  
- **Navigation:** Consistent menus for intuitive browsing.  
- **Movie Cards:** Display essential movie information in grid or list views.  
- **Watchlist Management:** Simple tools to add, remove, or organize movies.  
- **Review Writing:** Easy-to-use interfaces for creating text/image-based reviews.  

### 3. **Technical Requirements**  
Specifies the technologies and architecture needed for the platform:  
- **Backend:** Python-based Flask framework to handle requests and logic.  
- **Frontend:** Next.js for a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly UI.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data storage (e.g., user data, reviews, movie details).  
- **API:** RESTful API to enable communication between frontend and backend.  
- **Security:** HTTPS encryption and robust validation mechanisms (e.g., preventing SQL injection).  

### 4. **Infrastructure Requirements**  
Outlines the hosting and data management needs:  
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS or Google Cloud for scalable server infrastructure.  
- **Storage:** Cloud-based storage solutions for media files (e.g., posters, avatars).  
- **Database Server:** Cloud-based relational databases optimized for heavy traffic.  

### 5. **Testing Requirements**  
Defines the testing methodologies to ensure quality:  
- **Unit Testing:** Validate individual components in backend and frontend.  
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure different modules work together seamlessly.  
- **User Testing:** Gather feedback from users to improve the interface and fix issues.

## Why the SRS is Important  
The SRS provides a **clear roadmap** for the project, ensuring that:  
- Developers understand the technical specifications.  
- Designers have clear UX/UI goals.  
- The project progresses efficiently with fewer misunderstandings or rework.
